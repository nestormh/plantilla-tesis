\chapter{Stixel World}\label{ch:chapter04}

In the previous chapter, we saw a set of algorithms and configurations able to construct a disparity map from a pair of stereo images. These methods are useful for the reconstruction of the environment. However, this reconstruction is dense, which leads to an intensive usage of the computer resources. In order to solve this problem, some authors propose approaches that try to minimize the area of the image being processed by doing a simpler reconstruction than that done with dense 3D reconstruction algorithms. In this sense, \cite{badino2009stixel} proposed to represent the world by a set of rectangular sticks named \emph{stixels} (from \emph{stick} and \emph{pixel}). Each stixel is defined by its 3D position relative to the camera and stands vertically on the ground, having a certain height.
This compact but flexible representation of the world can be used as the common basis for the scene understanding tasks of driver assistance and autonomous systems. The main advantages of using such an approach are listed next:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Compact}. Significant reduction of the data volume.
 \item \emph{Complete}. Information of interest is preserved.
 \item \emph{Stable}. Small changes of the underlying data must not cause rapid changes within the representation.
 \item \emph{Robust}. Outliers must have minimal or no impact on the resulting representation.
\end{itemize}

The method described in this chapter is based in the fast stixels implementation described in \cite{benenson2012pedestrian}. One of the main advantages of this implementation is that there is no need of obtaining a previous depth map. This fact is also the main reason for which we did not use the original implementation from \cite{badino2009stixel} or that from \cite{pfeiffer2010efficient}. Based on the output of this method, we do the tracking of the stixels following a bipartite-graph method based on a given cost metric. In this sense, we have tested several cost metrics, which are described in the following sections.

Our tracking method is based on the contribution by \cite{gunyel2012stixels}. There, movement is just computed for the areas which are covered by stixels. It has been demonstrated that stixels are good enough to do a representation of the surroundings of a vehicle, and that they have a detail level enough for the movement detection. Traditionally, this movement detection is carried out through the computation of the optical flow between two frames, which is computationally expensive. In this chapter, we will see how this movement can be computed also using the stixel world representation, by extending the method of \cite{gunyel2012stixels}. For that, we have followed two different approaches, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. The first tries to cluster the stixels in objects, so the tracking is performed at object level; the second joins the stixel tracking with the object tracking in a two level tracking schema.

Our contribution in this work is summarized next:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Improvement of the reconstruction obtained by the stixels. The free space computation without the use of a disparity map have some drawbacks. Some of them are related with the fact that the precision in the reconstruction of the obstacles is not good enough. The object reconstruction detection scheme proposed in this chapter allows the correction of the stixel depths and the removal of the fake obstacles, as described in sections \ref{ch:chapter04_02_01} and \ref{ch:chapter04_02_02}.
 \item Improvement of the results obtained by the method described in \cite{gunyel2012stixels}, in both object and two-level tracking approaches. We modified the method by using a graph-based approach instead of a \ac{DP} based method, as they did. 
 \item Different cost metrics for the tracking have been tested, with promising results. 
 \item Faster tracking. As we will see in section \ref{ch:chapter04_02_04}, the speed achieved with our implementation is better, specially in the object based tracking. The two-level tracking is also a little bit faster, thanks to the usage of a bipartite graph based method for the matching of the stixels between frames.
 \item \notsure{Robustness after a big change between images (for example, in presence of a low framerate).}
\end{enumerate}

In the following section, each of the steps of the method are detailed. At the end of the chapter some results are shown in order to evaluate the performance of the described method.

\section{The Method}\label{ch:chapter04_01}

The method follows a pipeline as that described in figure \ref{fig:cp04_pipeline}. First, from a given pair of images, the free space in front of the vehicle is computed in order to estimate the ground plane. From the extracted ground plane, stixels are obtained. Then, a two-level tracking approach is started. The first level is that corresponding to the tracking of the stixels. This stage is inspired by the work described in \cite{gunyel2012stixels}. The set of stixels computed for the current frame are compared with those from the previous frame. Based on this comparison, some of them are matched. At the same time, we cluster stixels based on their position once projected in the 3d world. Using the clusters and the tracked stixels, we start a new tracking step in which the tracking is performed at object level. At the end of this step, we will know the obstacles in the scene and their velocities, as well as an historic of the path followed by them that could be useful for future movement estimation.

We also propose another solution in which just the object level tracking is performed. In this case, instead of doing a comparison at stixel level, we compare each obstacle to the obstacles detected in the previous frame, so the stixel level tracking is not needed anymore. In section \ref{ch:chapter04_02}, we will see the advantages and drawbacks of using one or another approach.

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption{Pipeline of the stixels tracking method described in this chapter.}\label{fig:cp04_pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Free space computation}\label{ch:chapter04_01_01}

In this section and in the following, we will describe the stixel extraction method, which is similar to that described in \cite{benenson2012pedestrian}. This method works under the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The input of the algorithm is a calibrated stereo image pair.
 \item We use the Lambertian surface assumption.
 \item The ground is planar, at least at local level.
 \item The objects of interest are mainly vertical, and have a limited height range.
 \item Stereo rig has a negligible roll with respect to the ground plane.
\end{itemize}

In this section, we introduce the first step needed for the stixels estimation process, which is the ground plane estimation stage. This ground plane is estimated using the evidences collected in the \emph{v-disparity} domain. Instead of computing and projecting a depthmap obtained, for example, one of the methods evaluated in chapter \todoref{XXX}, the evidence is collected directly from matching the rows from the left and right images at different disparities, obtaining a cube $(U, V, D)$ in which each cell represents the cost of matching the pixel at $p_i(u_i, v_i) \in I_L$ with that at $q_i(u_i + d_i, v_i) \in I_R$. Here, $p_i$ and $q_i$ are pixels from the left ($I_L$) and right ($I_R$) images, respectively; and $u_i$, $v_i$ and $d_i$ are the different possible column, row and disparity values in the cube. In figure \ref{fig:cp04_freespace}, a graphical description of the obtained cube is represented.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{freespace}
  \caption{Free space computation process.}\label{fig:cp04_freespace}
\end{figure}

For each row $v_i$, the disparity with the lowest cost is extracted for each row, as depicted in figure \ref{XXX}. From these values, a robust line fitting is used in order to find the ground plane, which is represented by the following expression:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_ground_plane_function}
  d_i = f_{ground}(v_i)
\end{equation}

Using this equation, we can know the disparity associated to each row at ground level, which will we use later for the stixels computation. For optimization purposes, instead of collecting the evidences for each row below the horizon, just one out of each $N$ rows is computed. 

\subsection{Stixels extraction}\label{ch:chapter04_01_02}

With the ground plane, we can start detecting the stixels in the images. The way in which this is done is by dividing the image in multiple row bands $b_i$. Inside each band $b_i$, and for each column $u_i$, the pixel with the biggest horizontal gradient is selected. This reduces the computational cost while the possibilities of finding the border of the object accurately are increased. Also, one of the advantages of using bands and not the rows directly is that, in presence of a confusing horizontal line, the effect is compensated by the band height.

From \ref{fig:cp04_freespace}, we obtain:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_ground_plane_function_by_band}
  d(q_j, b_i) = f_{ground}(v(q_j, b_i))
\end{equation}

Here, $q_j$ makes reference to the stixel $j$, where the total number of stixels is the total number of columns in the image divided by a parameterized stixel width $\tau_{stixel\_width}$. That is, $j=1 \dots \tau_{stixel\_width}$. In general, interest objects are wider than one column, so computing an evidence for each column in the image is redundant. Each stixel is located in the column $u(q_j) = j \cdot \tau_{stixel\_width}$. $v(q_j, b_i)$ is a certain row inside the stixel $q_j$ in the band $b_i$. 

At this point, the goal is to localize the optimal band for each stixel. This is based on the following expression:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_stixel_band_cost}
  b^*_s (q) = \underset{b(q)}{\arg\min} \underset{q}{\sum}c_s(q, b(q)) + \underset{q_a, q_b}{\sum}s_s(v(q_a, b(q_a)), v(q_b, b(q_b)))
\end{equation}

Here, we can think on $c_s$ as the data term, while $s_s$ is the smooth term. $q_a$ and $q_b$ are neighbors. That is, $|q_a - q_b| = 1$

\paragraph{Data term}\label{ch:chapter04_01_02_01}

By computing the cost $c_s$, we know the likelihood of the presence of an stixel $q$ at the row band $b$. The lower the cost is, the more possible that there is a stixel. This cost is computed as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_stixel_band_cost_data_term}
  c_s(q, b) = c_o (u(q), d(q, b)) + c_g(u(q), d(q,b))
\end{equation}

This equation is composed by two terms:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Object cost($c_o$)}. It represents the cost of the presence of a vertical object. It just sums the evidence along the vertical column, using the expected height of the object, which is projected on the image using the distance given by the ground plane.
 \item \emph{Ground cost($c_g$)}. It represents the cost of a supporting ground being present, and sums the evidence along the ground plane.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Smooth term}\label{ch:chapter04_01_02_02}

The smooth term ($s_s$) forces to respect the left-right occlusion restrictions and promotes ground object boundaries with few jumps.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_stixel_band_cost_smooth_term}
  s_s(v_a, v_b) = 
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{cases}
    \infty & \text{if } d(v_a) < d(v_b) - 1 \\
    c_o(u_a, d(v_a)) & \text{if } d(v_a) \approx d(v_b) - 1 \\
    - \omega \cdot c_o(u_a, d(v_a)) & \text{if } q_a = q_b \\
    0 & \text{if } d(v_a) > d(v_b) - 1
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
\end{equation}

Here, $\omega$ is a free parameter, chosen by the user, which promotes boundaries with a few jumps. At this point, we will have extracted the stixels, obtaining a result similar to that shown at figure \ref{fig:cp04_stixels}, in which the stixels (in green) are superimposed to the left image from which they were extracted. For more information about the process described in sections \ref{ch:chapter04_01_01} and \ref{ch:chapter04_01_02}, please refer to \cite{benenson2012fast}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{stixels_over_original}
  \caption{Stixels superimposed to the frame from which they were extracted.}\label{fig:cp04_stixels}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tracking}\label{ch:chapter04_01_03}

At this point, we are ready to start tracking the stixels. As said before this tracking has been performed using two different approaches: one consists on two different tracking levels from the first one tracks the stixels independently (that is, each stixel at the previous frame $t - 1$ is matched with another - or none - at the current frame $t$). So it becomes a matching problem in which we try to find the minimal cost matching between frames. In \cite{gunyel2012stixels}, this minimal matching was done using \ac{DP}. In our implementation we use a bipartite graph matching based method. In a second level, stixels are clustered into objects, which are matched based on the previous stixels tracking.

In the other approach, just the second level is performed, tracking obstacles based on one of the cost metrics, without considering the stixels included in the objects (except for the clustering process). In the next sections, the tracking process is described. Please note that the process described in section \ref{ch:chapter04_01_03_01} is performed only for the two-level approach, while the process in \label{ch:chapter04_01_04} is common to both approaches, except from the differences explicitly indicated in that section.

For this stage, we made some assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item First, we assume that all stixels have been properly estimated.
 \item The maximal speed of the objects is limited, so we limit the search range between stixels to a certain threshold. This range depends on the distance of the stixel at the current frame and the frame rate. As there is just one stixel per column, we can limit also the matching process to a search into the $u$ direction.
 \item There is not a big temporal difference between two consecutive frames. That means that the same stixel at time $t$ and $t - 1$ should be similar. Also their height in meters should be similar. \notsure{As shown in section \ref{ch:chapter04_02_03_02}, this temporary consistence is more or less restrictive depending on the approach finally used for the tracking process.}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Stixels-level tracking}\label{ch:chapter04_01_03_01}

In this stage, the tracking is performed at stixel level. As we just try to match each stixel at column $q_i\{t\}$ with another in the previous frame $t - 1$, we can think on this process as a matching problem. The way in which we have solved this is through a bipartite graph, in which nodes are the stixels at frame $t$ and $t - 1$, and the edges are associated to a certain movement cost $c_m$, which is represented by the equation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_stixel_movement_cost}
  c_m(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\}) = 
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{cases}
    f_{cost}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\}) & \textbf{if} \text{ matching is applicable} \\
    \infty & \textbf{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
\end{equation}

Here, a matching is applicable if and only if the following restrictions are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $|X(u_i\{t\}) - X(u_j\{t - 1\})| < \tau_{max\_disp}$, where the free parameter $\tau_{max\_disp}$ indicates the maximal displacement of a certain stixel between frames; and $X(u)$ refers to its $X$ position in 3d coordinates.
 \item $u_i\{t\}$ is not a new stixel. That is, this is not the very first frame in which the stixel appears.
 \item Stixel $u_i\{t\}$ and $u_j\{t - 1\}$ are not occluded.
 \item $f_{cost}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\}) < \tau_{max\_cost}$.
\end{itemize}

Else, the cost is considered as infinity, so the link is not included in the graph. $f_{cost}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\})$ is a cost function which can be composed by different cost metrics, weighted by a set of parameters in the form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_cost_function}
\small
  \begin{align*}
  f_{cost}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\}) =~  & & \alpha_{SAD} & ~\cdot~ & f_{SAD}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\}) \\
      & + & \alpha_{hist} & ~\cdot~ & f_{hist}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\}) \\
      & + & \alpha_{height} & ~\cdot~ & f_{height}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\})
  \end{align*}
\end{equation}

Here, $\alpha_{SAD} + \alpha_{hist} + \alpha_{height} = 1$. $f_{SAD}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\})$, $f_{hist}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\})$ and $f_{height}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\})$ are the different cost metrics being tested, which are described next.

\subsubsection{\acf{SAD}}\label{ch:chapter04_01_03_01_01}

This cost is computed as the pixel-wise sum of the absolute differences over the RGB color scheme between $u_i\{t\}$ and $u_j\{t - 1\}$, following the expression

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_stixel_movement_sad_cost}
\tiny
f_{SAD}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\}) = 
\overset{v_b(q_i\{t\})}{\underset{v_1=v_a(q_i\{t\})}{\sum}}
\overset{v_b(q_j\{t - 1\})}{\underset{v_2=v_a(q_i\{t - 1\})}{\sum}}
| I_L\{t\}(u_i\{t\}, v_1) - I_L\{t - 1\}(u_j\{t - 1\}, v_2) |
\end{equation}

As it is very unlikely for both stixels to have the exact same height, they are resized to a dimension of $30\,px$. This metric was originally used in \cite{gunyel2012stixels} for the computation of the movement of the stixels. It has been used in our tests to compare the our results with those obtained by them in their implementation.

\subsubsection{Histograms matching}\label{ch:chapter04_01_03_01_02}

As said, the same stixel has not always the same size in different frames. This can happen because the position of the object partially represented by the stixel can change its depth in the scene, or due to noise in the height detection of the stixel. In order to normalize this, we have computed the histogram of each of the stixels being compared. Then, the cost is computed from the Hellinger distance between both histograms:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_stixel_movement_histograms_cost}
f_{SAD}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\}) = d(P, Q) = 2 \cdot \sqrt { 1 - \underset{i=1}{\overset{d}{\sum}}\sqrt{P_i \cdot Q_i}}
\end{equation}

Here, $P$ is the histogram of the stixel $u_i\{t\}$, and $Q$ is the histogram of the stixel $u_j\{t - 1\}$. $d$ is the number of bins in the histogram. In our implementation, $d = 256$.

\subsubsection{Height difference}\label{ch:chapter04_01_03_01_05}

This metric is used to complement the other two metrics, as by its own is not enough to do a matching, but it is good enough to help in the decision, in case of very similar scores in two or more possible matches. $f_{height}$ is computed as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_stixel_movement_height_cost}
f_{height}(u_i\{t\}, u_j\{t - 1\}) = 1 - |h(u_i\{t\} - h(u_j\{t - 1\})|
\end{equation}

, where $h(u)$ is the height of the stixel in column $u$. 

In our tests, we have tried different values for $\alpha_{SAD}$, $\alpha_{hist}$ and $\alpha_{height}$, obtaining the results shown in section \ref{ch:chapter04_02}, both in terms of performance and time. As said, the value obtained using the function $f_{cost}$ is used to weight the links between the nodes of a bipartite graph. This graph, whose nodes are the stixels at times $t$ and $t - 1$, is shown at figure \ref{fig:cp04_bipartite_graph}. In the top row, we can see the nodes (stixels) at current time, while in the lower row, previous stixels are represented. Costs of the match are represented by the edges, depicted in the image with the notation $\omega_{i,j}$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics{bipartite_graph}
\caption{Representation of the bipartite graph used for the matching process.}\label{fig:cp04_bipartite_graph}
\end{figure}

Over this graph, we solve the following maximization problem:

\comment{No estoy seguro de esta notación}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp04_match_minimization}
\mathcal{\hat{M}}=\underset{\mathcal{M}}{\arg\min} \underset{(i, j) \in \mathcal{M}}{\sum} \omega_{i,j}, 
~~~~\exists! (i, \cdot) \wedge \exists! (\cdot, j)
\end{equation}

This problem is solved using a $O(n \cdot m \cdot log(n))$ implementation of the Edmond's maximum weighted matching algorithm (\cite{edmonds1965paths}). The advantages of using this method instead the \ac{DP} implementation by \cite{gunyel2012stixels} is that we getter better times that the implementation available and, specially, we can ensure that each match is performed one-to-one. That is, in the \cite{gunyel2012stixels} implementation, the same stixel could be matched with more than one stixel from the other frame. This is not good, as we can have multiple paths from the same stixel, so it is difficult to know the trajectory it has followed in the past. In our implementation, we choose the matching set that maximizes the whole matching, ensuring that one stixel is matched with \emph{only} one stixel in the other frame.

\subsection{Obstacle-level tracking}\label{ch:chapter04_01_04}

In this stage, we perform the tracking at obstacle level, and not at stixel level, as described in the previous section. In the case of two-level tracking, we should have at this point the set of matchings $m(i,j) \in \mathcal{M}$, which relates each stixel at column $u_i$ in the frame $t$ with the stixel at column $u_j$ in the frame $t - 1$. Anyway, we do not really need to have these matches for this stage, and do the tracking directly at the obstacle level. This section comprises two steps: object detection (clustering) and object tracking.
