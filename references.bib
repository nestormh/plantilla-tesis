  abstract={The world's forest ecosystems are in a state of permanent flux at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Monitoring techniques based on multispectral satellite-acquired data have demonstrated potential as a means to detect, identify, and map changes in forest cover. This paper, which reviews the methods and the results of digital change detection primarily in temperate forest ecosystems, has two major components. First, the different perspectives from which the variability in the change event has been approached are summarized, and the appropriate choice of digital imagery acquisition dates and interval length for change detection are discussed. In the second part, preprocessing routines to establish a more direct linkage between digital remote sensing data and biophysical phenomena, and the actual change detection methods themselves are reviewed and critically assessed. A case study in temperate forests (north-central U.S.A.) then serves as an illustration of how the different change detection 
  phases discussed in this paper can be integrated into an efficient and successful monitoring technique. Lastly, new developments in digital change detection such as the use of radar imagery and knowledge-based expert systems are highlighted.},

  abstract={Detecting regions of change in multiple images of the same scene taken at different times is of widespread interest due to a large number of applications in diverse disciplines, including remote sensing, surveillance, medical diagnosis and treatment, civil infrastructure, and underwater sensing. This paper presents a systematic survey of the common processing steps and core decision rules in modern change detection algorithms, including significance and hypothesis testing, predictive models, the shading model, and background modeling. We also discuss important preprocessing methods, approaches to enforcing the consistency of the change mask, and principles for evaluating and comparing the performance of change detection algorithms. It is hoped that our classification of algorithms into a relatively small number of categories will provide useful guidance to the algorithm designer. © 2005 IEEE.},

  abstract={No feature-based vision system can work unless good features can be identified and tracked from frame to frame. Although tracking itself is by and large a solved problem, selecting features that can be tracked well and correspond to physical points in the world is still hard. We propose a feature selection criterion that is optimal by construction because it is based on how the tracker works, and a feature monitoring method that can detect occlusions, disocclusions, and features that do not correspond to points in the world. These methods are based on a new tracking algorithm that extends previous Newton-Raphson style search methods to work under affine image transformations. We test performance with several simulations and experiments.},

  abstract={An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest-neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low-residual least-squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially-occluded images with a 
  computation time of under 2 seconds.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of stitching Giga Pixel images from airborne images acquired over multiple flight paths of Costa Rica in 2005. The set of input images contains about 10,158 images, each of size around 4072x4072 pixels, with very coarse georeferencing information (latitude and longitude of each image). Given the spatial coverage and resolution of the input images, the final stitched color image is 294,847 by 269,195 pixels (79.3 Giga Pixels) and corresponds to 238.2 GigaBytes. An assembly of such large images requires either hardware with large shared memory or algorithms using disk access in tandem with available RAM providing data for local image operation. In addition to I/O operations, the computations needed to stitch together image tiles involve at least one image transformation and multiple comparisons to place the pixels into a pyramid representation for fast dissemination. The motivation of our work is to explore the utilization of multiple hardware architectures (e.g., 
  multicore servers, computer clusters) and parallel computing to minimize the time needed to stitch Giga pixel images. Our approach is to utilize the coarse georeferencing information for initial image grouping followed by an intensitybased stitching of groups of images. This group-based stitching is highly parallelizable. The stitching process results in image patches that can be cropped to fit a tile of an image pyramid frequently used as a data structure for fast image access and retrieval. We report our experimental results obtained when stitching a four Giga Pixel image from the input images at one fourth of their original spatial resolution using a single core on our eight core server and our preliminary results for the entire 79.3 Gigapixel image obtained using a 120 core computer cluster.},

  title={Non-rigid structure from motion using ranklet-based tracking and non-linear optimization},
  journal={Image and Vision Computing},
  volume={25},
  number={3},
  pages={297-310},
  abstract={In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the 3D structure and motion of a deformable object given a set of image features tracked automatically throughout a video sequence. Our contributions are twofold: firstly, we propose a new approach to improve motion and structure estimates using a non-linear optimization scheme and secondly we propose a tracking algorithm based on ranklets, a recently developed family of orientation selective rank features. It has been shown that if the 3D deformations of an object can be modeled as a linear combination of shape bases then both its motion and shape may be recovered using an extension of Tomasi and Kanade's factorization algorithm for affine cameras. Crucially, these new factorization methods are model free and work purely from video in an unconstrained case: a single uncalibrated camera viewing an arbitrary 31) surface which is moving and articulating. The main drawback of existing methods is that they do not provide correct structure and   motion estimates: the motion matrix has a repetitive structure which is not respected by the factorization algorithm. In this paper, we present a non-linear optimization method to refine the motion and shape estimates which minimizes the image reprojection error and imposes the correct structure onto the motion matrix by choosing an appropriate parameterization. Factorization algorithms require as input a set of feature tracks or correspondences found throughout the image sequence. The challenge here is to track the features while the object is deforming and the appearance of the image therefore changing. We propose a model free tracking algorithm based on ranklets, a multi-scale family of rank features that present an orientation selectivity pattern similar to Haar wavelets. A vector of ranklets is used to encode an appearance based description of a neighborhood of each tracked point. Robustness is enhanced by adapting, for each point, the shape of the filters to the structure of the particular neighborhood. A stack of models is maintained for each tracked point in order to manage large appearance variations with limited drift. Our experiments on sequences of a human subject performing different facial expressions show that this tracker provides a good set of feature correspondences for the non-rigid 3D reconstruction algorithm.

  title={Dense trajectories and motion boundary descriptors for action recognition},
  author={Wang, Heng and Kl{\"a}ser, Alexander and Schmid, Cordelia and Liu, Cheng-Lin},
  abstract={This paper introduces a video representation based on dense trajectories and motion boundary descriptors. Trajectories capture the local motion information of the video. A dense representation guarantees a good coverage of foreground motion as well as of the surrounding context. A state-of-the-art optical flow algorithm enables a robust and efficient extraction of dense trajectories. As descriptors we extract features aligned with the trajectories to characterize shape (point coordinates), appearance (histograms of oriented gradients) and motion (histograms of optical flow). Additionally, we introduce a descriptor based on motion boundary histograms (MBH) which rely on differential optical flow. The MBH descriptor shows to consistently outperform other state-of-the-art descriptors, in particular on real-world videos that contain a significant amount of camera motion. We evaluate our video representation in the context of action classification on nine datasets, namely KTH, YouTube, Hollywood2, UCF 
sports, IXMAS, UIUC, Olympic Sports, UCF50 and HMDB51. On all datasets our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art results.},
