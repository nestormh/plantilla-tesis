abstract = {In in this paper, we propose a new model regarding foreground and shadow detection in video sequences. The model works without detailed a priori object-shape information, and it is also appropriate for low and unstable frame rate video sources. Contribution is presented in three key issues: 1) we propose a novel adaptive shadow model, and show the improvements versus previous approaches in scenes with difficult lighting and coloring effects; 2) we give a novel description for the foreground based on spatial statistics of the neighboring pixel values, which enhances the detection of background or shadow-colored object parts; 3) we show how microstructure analysis can be used in the proposed framework as additional feature components improving the results. Finally, a Markov random field model is used to enhance the accuracy of the separation. We validate our method on outdoor and indoor sequences including real surveillance videos and well-known benchmark test sets.},

abstract = {Multi-object tracking can be achieved by detecting objects in individual frames and then linking detections across frames. Such an approach can be made very robust to the occasional detection failure: If an object is not detected in a frame but is in previous and following ones, a correct trajectory will nevertheless be produced. By contrast, a false-positive detection in a few frames will be ignored. However, when dealing with a multiple target problem, the linking step results in a difficult optimization problem in the space of all possible families of trajectories. This is usually dealt with by sampling or greedy search based on variants of Dynamic Programming, which can easily miss the global optimum. In this paper, we show that reformulating that step as a constrained flow optimization results in a convex problem. We take advantage of its particular structure to solve it using the k-shortest paths algorithm, which is very fast. This new approach is far simpler formally and algorithmically than existing techniques and lets us demonstrate excellent performance in two very different contexts.},

abstract = {Optical flow estimation is classically marked by the requirement of dense sampling in time. While coarse-to-fine warping schemes have somehow relaxed this constraint, there is an inherent dependency between the scale of structures and the velocity that can be estimated. This particularly renders the estimation of detailed human motion problematic, as small body parts can move very fast. In this paper, we present a way to approach this problem by integrating rich descriptors into the variational optical flow setting. This way we can estimate a dense optical flow field with almost the same high accuracy as known from variational optical flow, while reaching out to new domains of motion analysis where the requirement of dense sampling in time is no longer satisfied.},

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

abstract = {Autonomous robot navigation involves many challenges and difficulties which are augmented when multiple robots operate together. Sophisticated computational techniques are required to cope with autonomous navigation in collective robotics, being the biologically-inspired approaches the most frequently adopted. Stigmergy, i.e. the ants communication by means of pheromones, is the main biological metaphor used in this work to perform multi-robot communication. The robots will be able to mark regions of the environment with artificial pheromones, according to past experiences, assisting one another in a cooperative and indirect way to accomplish the navigation objectives. Each robot is controlled by an autonomous navigation system (ANS) based on learning classifier system, which evolves during navigation from no a priori knowledge. Besides learning to avoid obstacles and capture targets, the systems must also learn how and where to lay artificial pheromones. Some experiments and simulations are performed intending to particularly investigate the ANS from three main perspectives: capability of learning to achieve the navigation objectives in collective scenarios, adaptability in face of environmental changes and ability to obtain optimized navigation behaviors by means of stigmergy.},

First, we explain a Local Generalized Voronoi Angle(LGA) to represent the edge data in 1-dimension. Second, we suggest a key factor extraction procedure from the LGA to reduce the number by 27-28 times for computational efficiency using the wavelet transformation. Finally we propose a way of data association using the key factors of the LGA.

@article{delbue2007nonrigid,
abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the 3D structure and motion of a deformable object given a set of image features tracked automatically throughout a video sequence. Our contributions are twofold: firstly, we propose a new approach to improve motion and structure estimates using a non-linear optimization scheme and secondly we propose a tracking algorithm based on ranklets, a recently developed family of orientation selective rank features. It has been shown that if the 3D deformations of an object can be modeled as a linear combination of shape bases then both its motion and shape may be recovered using an extension of Tomasi and Kanade's factorization algorithm for affine cameras. Crucially, these new factorization methods are model free and work purely from video in an unconstrained case: a single uncalibrated camera viewing an arbitrary 31) surface which is moving and articulating. The main drawback of existing methods is that they do not provide correct structure and motion estimates: the motion matrix has a repetitive structure which is not respected by the factorization algorithm. In this paper, we present a non-linear optimization method to refine the motion and shape estimates which minimizes the image reprojection error and imposes the correct structure onto the motion matrix by choosing an appropriate parameterization. Factorization algorithms require as input a set of feature tracks or correspondences found throughout the image sequence. The challenge here is to track the features while the object is deforming and the appearance of the image therefore changing. We propose a model free tracking algorithm based on ranklets, a multi-scale family of rank features that present an orientation selectivity pattern similar to Haar wavelets. A vector of ranklets is used to encode an appearance based description of a neighborhood of each tracked point. Robustness is enhanced by adapting, for each point, the shape of the filters to the structure of the particular neighborhood. A stack of models is maintained for each tracked point in order to manage large appearance variations with limited drift. Our experiments on sequences of a human subject performing different facial expressions show that this tracker provides a good set of feature correspondences for the non-rigid 3D reconstruction algorithm.

@article{diego2011video,
abstract = {In this work, we address the problem of aligning two video sequences. Such alignment refers to synchronization, i.e., the establishment of temporal correspondence between frames of the first and second video, followed by spatial registration of all the temporally corresponding frames. Video synchronization and alignment have been attempted before, but most often in the relatively simple cases of fixed or rigidly attached cameras and simultaneous acquisition. In addition, restrictive assumptions have been applied, including linear time correspondence or the knowledge of the complete trajectories of corresponding scene points; to some extent, these assumptions limit the practical applicability of any solutions developed. We intend to solve the more general problem of aligning video sequences recorded by independently moving cameras that follow similar trajectories, based only on the fusion of image intensity and GPS information. The novelty of our approach is to pose the synchronization as a MAP inference problem on a Bayesian network including the observations from these two sensor types, which have been proved complementary. Alignment results are presented in the context of videos recorded from vehicles driving along the same track at different times, for different road types. In addition, we explore two applications of the proposed video alignment method, both based on change detection between aligned videos. One is the detection of vehicles, which could be of use in ADAS. The other is online difference spotting videos of surveillance rounds.},

abstract = {. Multiclass SVMs are usually implemented by combining several two-class SVMs. The one-versus-all method using winner-takes-all strategy and the one-versus-one method implemented by max-wins voting are popularly used for this purpose. In this paper we give empirical evidence to show that these methods are inferior to another one-versusone method: one that uses Platt’s posterior probabilities together with the pairwise coupling idea of Hastie and Tibshirani. The evidence is particularly strong when the training dataset is sparse. 1},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of multiperson tracking in busy pedestrian zones using a stereo rig mounted on a mobile platform. The complexity of the problem calls for an integrated solution that extracts as much visual information as possible and combines it through cognitive feedback cycles. We propose such an approach, which jointly estimates camera position, stereo depth, object detection, and tracking. The interplay between those components is represented by a graphical model. Since the model has to incorporate object-object interactions and temporal links to past frames, direct inference is intractable. We, therefore, propose a two-stage procedure: for each frame, we first solve a simplified version of the model (disregarding interactions and temporal continuity) to estimate the scene geometry and an overcomplete set of object detections. Conditioned on these results, we then address object interactions, tracking, and prediction in a second step. The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and difficult video sequences from busy inner-city locations. Our results show that the proposed integration makes it possible to deliver robust tracking performance in scenes of realistic complexity.},

@article{Garcia2009,
abstract = {In the Motion Planning research field, heuristic methods have demonstrated to outperform classical approaches gaining popularity in the last 35 years. Several ideas have been proposed to overcome the complex nature of this NP-Complete problem. Ant Colony Optimization algorithms are heuristic methods that have been successfully used to deal with this kind of problems. This paper presents a novel proposal to solve the problem of path planning for mobile robots based on Simple Ant Colony Optimization Meta-Heuristic (SACO-MH). The new method was named SACOdm, where d stands for distance and m for memory. In SACOdm, the decision making process is influenced by the existing distance between the source and target nodes; moreover the ants can remember the visited nodes. The new added features give a speed up around 10 in many cases. The selection of the optimal path relies in the criterion of a Fuzzy Inference System, which is adjusted using a Simple Tuning Algorithm. The path planner application has two operating modes, one is for virtual environments, and the second one works with a real mobile robot using wireless communication. Both operating modes are global planners for plain terrain and support static and dynamic obstacle avoidance.},

abstract = {This paper presents a hierarchical scheme with block-based and pixel-based codebooks for foreground detection. The codebook is mainly used to compress information to achieve a high efficient processing speed. In the block-based stage, 12 intensity values are employed to represent a block. The algorithm extends the concept of the block truncation coding, and thus it can further improve the processing efficiency by enjoying its low complexity advantage. In detail, the block-based stage can remove most of the backgrounds without reducing the true positive rate, yet it has low precision. To overcome this problem, the pixel-based stage is adopted to enhance the precision, which also can reduce the false positive rate. Moreover, the short-term information is employed to improve background updating for adaptive environments. As documented in the experimental results, the proposed algorithm can provide superior performance to that of the former related approaches.},

We evaluate the insensitivity of different costs for passive binocular stereo methods with respect to radiometric variations of the input images. We consider both pixel-based and window-based variants like the absolute difference, the sampling-insensitive absolute difference, and normalized cross correlation, as well as their zero-mean versions. We also consider filters like LoG, mean, and bilateral background subtraction (BilSub) and nonparametric measures like Rank, SoftRank, Census, and Ordinal. Finally, hierarchical mutual information (HMI) is considered as pixelwise cost. Using stereo data sets with ground-truth disparities taken under controlled changes of exposure and lighting, we evaluate the costs with a local, a semiglobal, and a global stereo method. We measure the performance of all costs in the presence of simulated and real radiometric differences, including exposure differences, vignetting, varying lighting, and noise. Overall, the ranking of methods across all data sets and experiments appears to be consistent. Among the best costs are BilSub, which performs consistently very well for low radiometric differences; HMI, which is slightly better as pixelwise matching cost in some cases and for strong image noise; and Census, which showed the best and most robust overall performance.},

@article{hsu2002comparison,
abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) were originally designed for binary classification. How to effectively extend it for multiclass classification is still an ongoing research issue. Several methods have been proposed where typically we construct a multiclass classifier by combining several binary classifiers. Some authors also proposed methods that consider all classes at once. As it is computationally more expensive to solve multiclass problems, comparisons of these methods using large-scale problems have not been seriously conducted. Especially for methods solving multiclass SVM in one step, a much larger optimization problem is required so up to now experiments are limited to small data sets. In this paper we give decomposition implementations for two such "all-together" methods. We then compare their performance with three methods based on binary classifications: "one-against-all," "one-against-one," and directed acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM). Our experiments indicate that the "one-against-one" and DAG methods are more suitable for practical use than the other methods. Results also show that for large problems methods by considering all data at once in general need fewer support vectors.},

@article{kavraki1996probabilistic,
abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (\&ap;150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds)},

These problems have been addressed in literature with several probabilistic approaches based on mixture models. Here we propose a new kind of probabilistic background models which is based on probabilistic self-organising maps. This way, the background pixels are modeled with more flexibility. On the other hand, a statistical correlation measure is used to test the similarity among nearby pixels, so as to enhance the detection performance by providing a feedback to the process. Several well known benchmark videos have been used to assess the relative performance of our proposal with respect to traditional neural and non neural based methods, with favourable results, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A statistical analysis of the differences among methods demonstrates that our method is significantly better than its competitors. This way, a strong alternative to classical methods is presented.},

Aside from the intrinsic usefulness of being able to segment video streams into moving and background components, detecting moving objects provides a focus of attention for recognition, classification, and activity analysis, making these later steps more efficient. We propose an approach based on self organization through artificial neural networks, widely applied in human image processing systems and more generally in cognitive science. The proposed approach can handle scenes containing moving backgrounds, gradual illumination variations and camouflage, has no bootstrapping limitations, can include into the background model shadows cast by moving objects, and achieves robust detection for different types of videos taken with stationary cameras. We compare our method with other modeling techniques and report experimental results, both in terms of detection accuracy and in terms of processing speed, for color video sequences that represent typical situations critical for video surveillance systems.},

By using the Tabu search meta-heuristic method, a set of tabu (i.e., forbidden) moves are defined in each iteration of the search to confine the robot's navigable locations, and guide it toward the goal. Based on range-sensor readings and the cost function value defined for each ray, the robot is attracted to certain obstacle vertices, and moves along a path consisted of lines connecting the vertices of different obstacles. Hence, the resulting trajectory has a local shortest path quality similar to the visibility graph roadmap. The planner also takes advantage of random moves when trapped in dead-ends. Different experiments have shown the efficiency of this approach.},

A collision-free path connecting a start and a goal point provides information on the division of the space. In the case of 2D path planning, for example, the path divides the space into two regions. This suggests a dual problem of first dividing the whole space into such two regions and then picking up the boundary as a path. We develop a method of solving this dual problem using support vector machine (SVM). SVM generates a nonlinear separating surface based on the margin maximization principle. This property is suitable for the purpose of usual path planning problems, that is, generating a safe and smooth path. The details of the path planning methods in 2D and 3D spaces are described with several planning results. Future possibilities of combining the proposed concept with other path planning methodologies are also discussed},

abstract = {A modified ant algorithms is presented as a fast and efficient approach for path planning of UCAV in this paper. To fleetly and reliably accomplish the air combat task, the path planning plays an extremely important role in the design of UCAV. The planned path can ensure UCAV reach the destination along the optimization path with the minimum probability of being found and the minimum energy consumed cost. Due to the big search space, the original ant algorithm can easily converge to local best solutions, and the search speed is slow. For avoiding these disadvantages, an improved ant algorithm is given and it is used to optimize path of UCAV. The modified ant algorithm can improve the speed of selection course, and decrease the probability of local best solutions. When UCAV meets the unexpected threat during its fly, it needs to revise the aforehand given path with re-planning technology. Based on the modified ant algorithm, a new method of three-dimensional real-time path re-planning is presented for UCAV. The simulation results show that this proposed path-planning scheme can obtain the optimization path which can be re-optimized when the unexpected threats appear.},

abstract = {Point set registration is a key component in many computer vision tasks. The goal of point set registration is to assign correspondences between two sets of points and to recover the transformation that maps one point set to the other. Multiple factors, including an unknown nonrigid spatial transformation, large dimensionality of point set, noise, and outliers, make the point set registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and nonrigid point set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability density estimation problem. We fit the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) centroids (representing the first point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by reparameterization of GMM centroid locations with rigid parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the nonrigid case, we impose the coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and nonrigid transformations in the presence of noise, outliers, and missing points, where CPD shows accurate results and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Summary. We describe an approach for analysis of surveillance video taken from moving vehicles making repeated passes through a specific, well-defined corridor. Our goal is to detect stationary objects which have appeared in scenes along the established route. Our motivation is to address security concerns in hostile theaters where stationary surveillance cameras would be destroyed almost immediately; yet mobile camera platforms; i.e., group transport vehicles/convoys are plentiful. Challenges include illumination changes from different time/day, and handling parallax resulting from our non-stationary camera. We provide an example using artificial surveillance images taken on the Stanford University campus. Scale-up to critical security theaters would be straightforward. The approach is equally applicable to images collected by aircraft.},

Here, we introduce an approach to creating such models for deformable 3D surfaces. We exploit the fact that the shape of an inextensible triangulated mesh can be parameterized in terms of a small subset of the angles between its facets. We use this set of angles to create a representative set of potential shapes, which we feed to a simple dimensionality reduction technique to produce low-dimensional 3D deformation models. We show that these models can be used to accurately model a wide range of deforming 3D surfaces from video sequences acquired under realistic conditions.},

The algorithm generates acollision free path for mobile robots running between two tracksor moving towards a known way point. This approach cannegotiate tracks and avoid obstacles which may be initially unknownbut are later perceived by the robot, and hence issuitable for use with onboard sensors which provides local information.The approach involves dividing the whole terrain into two differentclasses, classifying any new point obtained from sensors into eitherof the classes, and generating a track between both theclasses as a path of the robot. SVM generates anon-linear class boundary on the principle of maximizing the margin.The boundary generated by this method is smooth, free ofobstacles, and safe for a robot to navigate. The paperpresents various case studies and simulation results. Future possibility tointegrate this technique with other path planning techniques is alsodiscussed. ©2008 ASME},

Complex obstacles and maps havebeen created in the simulation environment of Player/Stage.

abstract = {This paper introduces a video representation based on dense trajectories and motion boundary descriptors. Trajectories capture the local motion information of the video. A dense representation guarantees a good coverage of foreground motion as well as of the surrounding context. A state-of-the-art optical flow algorithm enables a robust and efficient extraction of dense trajectories. As descriptors we extract features aligned with the trajectories to characterize shape (point coordinates), appearance (histograms of oriented gradients) and motion (histograms of optical flow). Additionally, we introduce a descriptor based on motion boundary histograms (MBH) which rely on differential optical flow. The MBH descriptor shows to consistently outperform other state-of-the-art descriptors, in particular on real-world videos that contain a significant amount of camera motion. We evaluate our video representation in the context of action classification on nine datasets, namely KTH, YouTube, Hollywood2, UCF 
sports, IXMAS, UIUC, Olympic Sports, UCF50 and HMDB51. On all datasets our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art results.},

@article{zhang2007evolutionary,
abstract = {An evolutionary algorithm (EA) can be used to tune the control parameters of a construction heuristic to an optimization problem and generate a nearly optimal solution. This approach is in the spirit of indirect encoding EAs. Its performance relies on both the heuristic and the EA. This paper proposes a three-phase parameterized construction heuristic for the shared-path protection problem in wavelength division multiplexing networks with shared-risk link group constraints and applies an EA for optimizing the control parameters of the proposed heuristics. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective on all the tested network instances. It was also demonstrated that an EA with guided mutation performs better than a conventional genetic algorithm for tuning the control parameters, which indicates that a combination of global statistical information extracted from the previous search and location information of the best solutions found so far could improve the performance of an algorithm.},

@article{zheng2006robust,
abstract = {In previous work on point matching, a set of points is often treated as an instance of a joint distribution to exploit global relationships in the point set. For nonrigid shapes, however, the local relationship among neighboring points is stronger and more stable than the global one. In this paper, we introduce the lotion of a neighborhood structure for the general point matching problem. We formulate point matching as an optimization problem to preserve local neighborhood structures during matching. Our approach has a simple graph matching interpretation, where each point is a node in the graph, and two nodes are connected by an edge if they are neighbors. The optimal match between two graphs is the one that maximizes the number of matched edges. Existing techniques are leveraged to search for an optimal solution with the shape context distance used to initialize the graph matching, followed by relaxation labeling updates for refinement. Extensive experiments show the robustness of our approach under deformation, noise in point locations, outliers, occlusion, and rotation. It outperforms the shape context and TPS-RPM algorithms on most scenarios.},

However, artificial potential field approach has a major problem, which is that the robot is easy to be trapped at a local minimum before reaching its goal. The avoidance of local minimum has been an active research topic in path planning by potential field. In this paper, we introduce several methods to solve this problem, emphatically, introduce and evaluate the artificial potential field approach with simulated annealing (SA). As one of the powerful techniques for escaping local minimum, simulated annealing has been applied to local and global path planning},

@article{zhu2011new,
abstract = {A difficult issue in robot navigation or path planning in an unknown environment with static or dynamic obstacles is to find a globally optimal path from the start to the target point and at the same time avoid collisions. We present a novel and effective robot navigation algorithm for dynamic unknown environments based on an improved ant-based algorithm. In our approach two bidirectional groups of scout ants cooperate with each other to find a local optimal static navigation path within the visual domain of the robot. The robot then predicts the collision points with moving objects, and the scout ants find a new collision-free local navigation path. This process is carried out dynamically after each step of the robot, thereby allowing the robot to adjust its path as new obstacles come into view or existing obstacles move in new directions. Therefore, the robot can not only avoid collision but also make its paths globally optimal or near-optimal by making a series of dynamic adjustments to locally optimal paths. The simulation results have shown that the algorithm has good effect, high real-time performance, and is very suitable for real-time navigation in complex and dynamic environments.},
