\chapter{Local Planning}\label{ch:chapter07}

Path planning allows an autonomous vehicle to determine the behavior of a vehicle by itself. With this in mind, the vehicle is at this moment able to detect the obstacles in the surrounding area, and has the knowledge of how to reach a certain point in the map from the current position. It is time to make the vehicle drive by itself along this path, avoiding the obstacles in the way.
Despite the global path tell us the safest and shortest path to the goal, we can not use it to directly compute the commands the vehicle needs to start driving, as this global path does not model the long term unpredictability of the environment. Due to the presence of obstacles, this environment is constantly changing. So we need to follow the trajectory using an intermediate mechanism that introduces this short-term information.

\section{The Method}\label{ch:chapter07_01}

The way in which we have solved this problem is based on the method described in \cite{chu2012local} and by \cite{thrun2006stanley}, and modified in order to adapt it to the requirements of our system and the specific characteristics of our prototype, Verdino. Other changes are introduced with the aim of improving the behavior of the whole system.
In our method, we consider the global path obtained in section \todoref{XXX} as the base frame of a curvilinear coordinates system, which will be the paths generation space. The directional information of this path is included, in the way that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The nearest point (where the distance is computed perpendicular to the global path) to the main trajectory will be the origin of the curvilinear coordinates system.
 \item The horizontal axis will be represented by the distance over global path itself, on its own direction.
 \item The vertical axis is represented by the line perpendicular the origin point, in the left sense regarding to the path direction.
\end{itemize}
With this schema, we can compute easily the trajectories in the curvilinear space (maneuvering information is created), which are then transformed to the initial euclidean space, in which the obstacles information is added by assigning costs to each of the paths.

As said, we were inspired from the works of \cite{chu2012local} and \cite{thrun2006stanley}. From \cite{thrun2006stanley}, we adopted the way in which the distance to the center of the path is used as part of the cost function. However, as explained in the previous section, our path calculation is different due to the environments in which Verdino will be working. In their work, they used a Kalman filter based method.
From \cite{chu2012local}, we based our cost function also in the path smoothness and the cost of the collision with the obstacles computed as a function of the distance to them. This cost is computed by blurring the binary map of the obstacles. In our method, we use a exponential function relative to the distance to the obstacles and the footprint of the car.
We also use as cost functions the length and the curvature of the path. These cost functions will be explained in more detail in section \todoref{XXX}. Both approaches use of a base frame relative to the global path as tool for an easy and efficient computation of the paths.

The obtained algorithm has been applied over Verdino. At the end of this chapter, some experimental results are shown. \comment{Si da tiempo: }Also, there are a set of videos showing the proper behavior of the vehicle in real situations.

The path generation method can be divided in five stages, shown at figure \ref{fig:cp07_pipeline}.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \emph{Generation of the costmap.} Using the information generated by the sensors, the system constructs a costmap in which costs are related to the distance to the obstacles.
 \item \emph{Base frame construction.} Based on the global path constructed in the previous section (see \todoref{XXX}), we construct the base frame of the curvilinear coordinate system.
 \item \emph{Candidate paths generation.} Candidate paths are generated into the curvilinear space. Then, they are transformed to the euclidean space.
 \item \emph{Selection of the winner path.} Costs of all the paths are assigned, and the one with the lowest value is selected.
 \item \emph{Computation of the vehicle commands.} Vehicle speed and steering angles are computed based on the characteristics of the winner path.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Generation of the costmap}\label{ch:chapter07_01_01}

The costmap maintains information about where the vehicle should navigate in the form of a occupancy grid. It uses sensor data and information from the static map to store and update information about obstacles in the world. In the tests shown in this chapter, information is obtained through the \acp{LIDAR} described at section \todoref{XXX-verdino}. \notsure{Some tests including the information obtained from the methods described in previous sections will be shown at section \todoref{XXX-alltogether}}. Each sensor is used to mark obstacles in the map, or clear them if they are no longer available.

Each cell in the map can have $255$ different cost values:
\begin{itemize}
 \item A value of $255$ means that we do not have information about an specific cell in the map.
 \item $254$ means that a sensor has marked this specific cell as occupied, which is considered as a lethal cell. The vehicle should never enter into this cell.
 \item The rest of cells are considered as free, but with different cost levels depending on an inflation method relative to the size of the vehicle and its distance to the obstacle.
\end{itemize}

Cost values out from occupied cells decrease with distance using the following expression:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp07_costmap_inflation}
 \mathcal{C}(i, j) = \exp (-1.0 \cdot \alpha \cdot ( \|c_{ij}-\vec{o}\| - \rho_{inscribed})) \cdot 253
\end{equation}

In this expression, $\alpha$ is a scaling factor that allows increasing or decreasing the decay rate of the cost of the obstacle. $\|c_{ij}-\vec{o}\|$ is the distance between the cell $c_{ij} \in \mathcal{C}$ (where $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of cells in the costmap) and the obstacle. Finally, $\rho_{inscribed}$ is the inscribed radius, which is the inner circle of the limits of the car. This radius is depicted in the figure \ref{fig:cp07_costmap_concepts}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\subfloat{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,trim=50 40 80 60,clip]{inscribed_circumscribed}} &
\subfloat{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,trim=50 40 80 60,clip]{cost_levels}}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Costmap computation concepts. On the left side, the inscribed and circumscribed radius are depicted. On the left, the different cost  levels are represented.}\label{fig:cp07_costmap_concepts}
\end{figure}

Despite all of them are free cells, we define four different distance thresholds in order to set different danger levels in the map, depicted in figure \ref{fig:cp07_costmap_concepts}:

\begin{itemize}
 \item $\tau_{lethal}$: There is a obstacle in this cell, marked by the sensor. Corresponds to the cost level $254$. The vehicle is in collision.
 \item $\tau_{inscribed}$: The cell distance to the nearest obstacle is below the value $\rho_{inscribed}$. If the center of the vehicle is in this cell, it is also in collision, so the areas below this distance threshold should be avoided. The cost level is always $253$.
 \item $\tau_{circumscribed}$: If the vehicle center is on this cell, there are chances to be in collision with an obstacle, depending on its orientation. A cell with a distance to an obstacle below this threshold should be avoided, but there are possibilities to be in one of them without colliding an obstacle. The rest of cells are assumed to be safe (except from those with \emph{unknown} cost).
\end{itemize}

We just consider in our approach the paths passing along areas with a distance to an obstacle over $\tau_{circumscribed}$, for which a cost will be assigned based on the equation \ref{eq:cp07_costmap_inflation} and other cost factors that will be explained later. Paths passing trough the rest of cells will be truncated at the last safe point.

For optimization reasons, we do not compute the costmap of the whole map at each iteration. Instead, we just compute the cells in a $40x40\,m$ area centered into the current car position. 

In the development of this method, we used the \ROS plugin \program{costmap\_2d}\footnote{\url{http://wiki.ros.org/costmap\_2d}}, which implements the functionalities described in this section. 

\subsection{Base frame construction}\label{ch:chapter07_01_02}

Instead of locating the vehicle in the new created frame, as done in \cite{chu2012local}, at each iteration we prune the global plan up to its nearest point to the car location, so the origin of the base frame will be the first point in the pruned global plan. This distance is measured in terms of the euclidean distance in the direction perpendicular to each point in the path. If the pruned plan is valid and its size is different from zero, we start the base frame construction stage.

In this stage, we will define the base frame of the curvilinear coordinate system, so the algorithm will be able to compute the trajectories in this space as if the global plan were a rectilinear trajectory. The geometric relationship between the path in euclidean coordinates and curvilinear coordinates is shown at figure \ref{fig:cp07_euclidean_frenet_conversion}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\subfloat{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,trim=50 40 80 60,clip]{justOneCartesian45}} &
\subfloat{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,trim=50 40 80 60,clip]{justOneFrenet45}}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Conversion of a trajectory between the Cartesian and FrenÃ©t spaces. \todo{Incluir la informaciÃ³n disponible en el paper original para estas figuras (9 y 10)}}\label{fig:cp07_euclidean_frenet_conversion}
\end{figure}


There, the longitude of the arc of the base frame ($s$, on the right image) is the distance along the global plan, which is represented as a green line. This distance is represented by the horizontal axis of the curvilinear system. The vertical axis, $q$, represents the perpendicular lateral distance respect to the path, so the left side is represented by positive values and the right by the negatives.

For the computation of the transformation between the euclidean coordinate system and the curvilinear, we need to compute the value $\kappa$, which represents the path curvature. This value is computed as follows (\cite{chu2012local}, \cite{werling2010optimal}, \cite{barfoot2004motion})

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp07_path_curvature}
 \kappa = {S \over Q} \cdot \left ( \kappa_b \cdot { 
 {(1 - q \cdot \kappa_b) \cdot (\partial^2q / \partial s^2) +
 \kappa_b \cdot (\partial q / \partial s )^2
 } 
 \over {Q^2} } \right )
\end{equation}

,where 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp07_path_curvature_s_and_q}
\begin{cases}
S=sign(1 - q \cdot \kappa_b)\\
Q=\sqrt{\left ( { {\partial q} \over {\partial s}} \right ) ^2+ (1 - q \cdot \kappa_b)^2}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Based on this, each generated path will be rejected in the following cases:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The lateral offset $q$ is similar to the curvature radius of the base frame $1 / \kappa_b$. In this case, the path passes through the center of curvature of the base frame.
 \item $q > {1 \over \kappa_b}$. In this case, the curvature and direction of the generated path has a sign opposed to the direction of the base frame. Path should be discarded, as it violates the non-holonomic condition of the movement of the vehicle.
\end{itemize}

Also, the maximal curvature a path can have in order to be feasible by the vehicle is limited by a restriction in the steering angle. If this restriction is violated, the corresponding path is rejected. This curvature is directly related to the movement of the vehicle, which can be described through several models. A simplified version, which ignores the related physical effects (like inertia or mass), is (\cite{chu2012local}, \cite{barfoot2004motion}):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp07_simplified_motion_model}
\begin{cases}
\dot{x} = |\vec{v}| \cdot cos(\theta) \\
\dot{y} = |\vec{v}| \cdot sin(\theta) \\
\dot{\theta} = |\vec{v}| \cdot \kappa
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

As these physical effects does not affect to the geometric shape of the path, we can avoid their usage. In equation \ref{eq:cp07_simplified_motion_model}, $[\dot{x} \dot{y} \dot{\theta} ]^T$ are the estimated position and orientation of the vehicle and $|\vec{v}|$ is the module of the speed. Taking into account this simplified model, we can assume that the vehicle just have two degrees of freedom, corresponding to the speed $\vec{v}$ and $\kappa$. As at this point we are just interested into the geometric generation of the path, we can remove the speed of the vehicle $\vec{v}$ from the model. The way in which this is done is by expressing the movement of the vehicle in terms of the traveled distance. So the following relation is established (\cite{chu2012local}):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp07_speed_to_distance}
|\vec{v}| = S \cdot Q \cdot { {\partial s} \over {\partial t}}
\end{equation}

If the speed of the vehicle is substituted into the model described in equation \ref{eq:cp07_simplified_motion_model}, the differential equation of the movement can be represented regarding to the arc length of the base frame as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp07_motion_model_in_distance_terms}
\begin{cases}
{{\partial x} \over {\partial s}} = Q \cdot cos(\theta) \\
{{\partial y} \over {\partial s}} = Q \cdot sin(\theta) \\
{{\partial \theta} \over {\partial s}} = Q \cdot \kappa
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The advantages of this new model is that it can be generated independently from the vehicle speed along the base frame.

\subsection{Candidate paths generation}\label{ch:chapter07_01_03}

As said previously, the generation of the paths corresponding to each of the maneuvers the car can follow is performed in the curvilinear space, independently from the obstacles in the environment. These will be taken into account later, once the tentative trajectories have been transformed to the euclidean space.

\subsubsection{Maneuvering paths generation}\label{ch:chapter07_01_03_01}

In order to generate a path, its curvature is defined by the lateral offset $q$ respect to the base frame. First and second order derivatives of $q$ are needed if we want to compute $\kappa$ (see equations \ref{eq:cp07_path_curvature} and \ref{eq:cp07_path_curvature_s_and_q}), so we need a function dependent to the lateral offset if we want a smooth lateral change.

$q$ can be defined by a sequence of a cubic polynomial and a set of constants:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp07_function_q}
\begin{align*}
q(s) &=
  \begin{cases}
   a \cdot \Delta s^3 + b \cdot \Delta s^2 + c \cdot \Delta s + q_i & \text{if } s_i \le s < s_f \\
   q_f        & \text{if } s_f \le s
  \end{cases}\\
{{\partial q} \over {\partial s}}(s) &=
  \begin{cases}
   3 \cdot a \cdot \Delta s^2 + 2 \cdot b \cdot \Delta s + c & ~~~~~~~\text{if } s_i \le s < s_f \\
   0        & ~~~~~~~\text{if } s_f \le s
  \end{cases}\\
{{\partial^2 q} \over {\partial s^2}}(s) &=
  \begin{cases}
   6 \cdot a \cdot \Delta s + 2 \cdot b & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\text{if } s_i \le s < s_f \\
   0        & ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\text{if } s_f \le s
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
\end{equation}

, where $\Delta s = s - s_i$.

In figure \ref{fig:cp07_euclidean_frenet_conversion}, the components involved in this process are depicted.
\begin{itemize}
 \item The initial lenght $s_i$ is zero, due to the prune task performed to the path at the beginning of each iteration. Lateral offset $q_i$ is also known, which is the lateral offset to the initial point of the global path.
 \item Angle $\theta$ defines the difference between the vehicle heading angle and the tangent angle of the base frame.
 \item $s_f$ is a parameter that allows controlling the longitudinal distance needed to reach the offset $q_f$. This distance should be dependent from the speed. However, as the maximal speed of the prototype is not too hight, we can set $\Delta s_f$ as the distance needed to go from $q_i$ to the biggest $q_f$ at the maximal speed.
 \item $q_f$s are computed for each path attending to the parameters defined by the user. $s_f$ is also a parameter.
\end{itemize}

Parameters $s_i$, $q_i$, and $s_f$ are the same for all the candidate paths. By modifying the value of $q_f$ we get the different paths. To do that, we divide the width of the road into as many segments as the desired number of paths. Then, $q_f$ will be a distance, perpendicular to the base frame, between the global path and the corresponding road width division depending on the number of path being generated. Using this technique, the desired number of paths is created, each of them with a different lateral offset $q_f$. The set of paths should cover the whole road width, so the vehicle should be able to avoid the obstacles if possible.

In our tests, we have considered a maximal width of 4\,m (a little bit above the width of the roads in our testing area), with an horizon of 10\,m in the direction of the global path. This horizon gives us a prediction of 2\,seconds at the maximal speed of the vehicle. We evaluate a total of 21 paths, with a distance between them ($\Delta q_f$) of 20\,cm.

\subsubsection{Candidate paths generation}\label{ch:chapter07_01_03_02}

Once we have computed the paths in the curvilinear coordinate system, we transform them so we they can be used in the euclidean space. In this new space, we will be able to evaluate their associated costs, as those related to the distance to obstacles, smoothness, etc. In figures \ref{fig:cp07_frenet0} and \ref{fig:cp07_frenet45}, we can see two examples of this process.

In figure \ref{fig:cp07_frenet0}, an example in which the vehicle is at a lateral distance of 1\,m respect to the base frame, and the orientation of the vehicle regarding to this base frame is 0. That is, $q_i = 1$, $s_i = 0$ and $\theta = 0$. In the left image, we see that the set of paths is symmetric, being the central path completely parallel to the axis $s$. These trajectories are then projected to the euclidean space, obtaining the paths represented in the right image. There, the green line represents the global path, and the blue lines are the projected candidate paths. As can be seen, they fit properly to the global path.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\subfloat{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,trim=50 40 80 60,clip]{frenet0}} &
\subfloat{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,trim=50 40 80 60,clip]{cartesian0}}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example in which the vehicle is oriented parallel to the path.}\label{fig:cp07_frenet0}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:cp07_frenet45}, a similar example is shown. The only difference is that, this time, the vehicle is oriented $45^\circ$ away from the base frame orientation. This causes the paths in the curvilinear space to move away from the $s$ axis until they start converging. Same effect occurs in the transformed euclidean paths: they get away from the global path but, after a few meters, they start approaching to it.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\subfloat{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,trim=50 40 80 60,clip]{frenet45}} &

\end{tabular}
\caption{Example in which the vehicle is rotated with respect to the path.}\label{fig:cp07_frenet45}
\end{figure}

Now we have the paths in the euclidean distance, we can evaluate which is the maximal distance they can reach individually if obstacles are considered. To do that, we iterate over the points in the trajectory, and check the cost associated to each cell $c_ij$ containing the point. If this cost is over the value associated to the threshold $\tau_{circumscribed}$, the path is truncated at this point. The points iterated before reaching this cost will be kept, but it is unlikely that this will be the winner path, as the occlusion cost (see section \todoref{XXX}) will be maximal, and the length of the path shorter (see section \todoref{XXXlengthCost}. The reason for that is that, as the car will be traveling in likely crowded areas, we want to keep moving even if we see that at this point each of the paths do not reach the maximal distance horizon. Obviously, in this case the speed is reduced according to the winner path length. Also, if there is a way to reach the horizon in one of the paths, this will be probably the winner one.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{example15}
\caption{Paths truncation example.}\label{fig:cp07_path_truncation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Selection of the winner path}\label{ch:chapter07_01_04}

The path is selected from among all the other paths based on a cost function which is a linear combination of other cost functions with weighting factors. The cost function evaluate the occlusion, length, distance to the global path, curvature and consistency of the path as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp07_cost_function}
J[i] = \omega_o C_o[i] + \omega_l C_l[i] + \omega_d C_d[i] + \omega_{\kappa} C_{\kappa}[i] + \omega_c C_c[i]
\end{equation}

Here, $i$ is the path index, and $C_o$, $C_l$, $C_d$, $C_{\kappa}$ and $C_c$ are the costs of occlusion, length, distance to the global path, curvature and consistency, respectively. Their relatives $\omega_k$, $k \in \{o, l, d, \kappa, c\}$ are the associate weights that allow to decide the influence of each of the costs to the final cost value.

As we will see in the next sections, all those costs are normalized to $1$, and 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cp07_weights_sum}
\sum_{{i \in \{o, l, d, \kappa, c\}}} w_i= 1
\end{equation}

, so it is easy to determine the proportional influence of each of the weights with respect to the others. Based on this, the value of $J[i]$ should fall inside the interval $[0\dots1]$.
